# [Manage-a-Book-Trading-Club](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/manage-a-book-trading-club)

A project that was created to earn a certificate from freeCodeCamp and allows users to trade books when they have an account.

## OAuth

[Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/) is used in order to use [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) for the following:

- GitHub
- Facebook
- Twitter
- Google

## Security

For security, this project uses:

- [CryptoJS](https://cryptojs.gitbook.io/docs/) to encrypt and decrypt users' addresses and zip/postal codes with [AES](https://cryptojs.gitbook.io/docs/#ciphers)
  - **NOTE:** All **[KEYS](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography)>)** are **STORED** in _**keys.xml**_
- [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) to hash and verify passwords
- [Helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) for extra protection

## Privacy

For privacy, this project protects users' privacy by:

- Giving users control over the profile data that is shared
  - **NOTE:** All **PROFILE DATA** is **PUBLIC** by **DEFAULT**
- Not requiring users to share accounts via OAuth
- Only requiring accounts to have a username and password

## Location APIs

Three location APIs are used to display menu options:

1. **[LocationIQ's Autocomplete API](https://locationiq.com/sandbox/geocoding/autocomplete)**
2. **[Country State City API](https://countrystatecity.in/)**
3. **[Zippopotamus](https://zippopotam.us/)**
